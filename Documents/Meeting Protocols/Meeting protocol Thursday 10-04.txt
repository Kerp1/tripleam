1. Objectives (5 min) Resolve any issues preventing the team to 
 continue (this should be possible to verify at next meeting, 
 short clear description, use issues from project site). 

2. Reports (15 min) From previous meetings, (un)solved issues, 
 We have implemented some more functionality, blocks can now be destroyed and tower have gotten some more functionaltiy.  We have also removed all traces of view related stuff from the model. 

3. Discussion items (35 min) 
How to handle sounds, if sounds are a part of the view how can model tell the view that a sound should be played while still preserving the mvc model?


Which design patterns should we include and use? And when should we start making testing the code? Which design patterns have we used so far?


How should we handle that some objects should be able to move through certain objects in certain states?



4. Outcomes and assignments (5 min) 

Entity should provide 2 new methods that subclasses can override.
The first method should take an entity as a parameter and return true or false whether the entity parameter are allowed to move through this object
The second method should be called when an object takes damage from an explosion and return true or false whether the explosion are allowed to continue forward or not.

Mattias should continue with the implementation of tower functionality.
Axel will focus on making explosions work properly.
Alex will give the a shot at sorting the list of entities that the view gets from the model.
Anton will implement functionality for the bomber her
