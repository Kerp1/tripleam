Meeting Agenda

Date: 31/3

Facilitator: Anton Freudenthaler

Participants: Anton Freudenthaler, Alex Tao, Axel Savén Östebo & Mattias Nilsen

1. Objectives (5 min) 


Talk about what to be done until next time and what we have done, also discuss any problems we have come across.

2. Reports (15 min) From previous meetings, (un)solved issues, 
We have implemented the first prototype of our game. We have implemented several classes. None of them are complete but together they can show a hero which can be moved and use a primary ability. 
There’s a lot of unsolved issues. We have different (and sometimes no) opinions on how the different classes should relate to each other. 



3. Discussion items (35 min) 
We discussed the relations between the classes.
 
We discussed how the constructors for different classes should look like, right now it seems like our constructors are way to complex, which makes the new objects too static.


We also discussed how to change color of the sprite, should we make another draw() method or should we change the color of the sprite at the initialization of the game?  


We also discussed what should be done till next time, how should we implement the movement system?


How will we implement the MVC design model?

4. Outcomes and assignments (5 min) 
We have decided to change color of the sprite at the initial startup. The assignment for this would be to make sure we can find a method to do this. 
We have to take even more time to plan how to build our game. 
Till next time we should have implemented the movement system. 
We have to reconstruct our code and separate View, Model and Controller.
