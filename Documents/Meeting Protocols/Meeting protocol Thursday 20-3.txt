Meeting Agenda

Date: 2014-03-20

Facilitator: Mattias Nilsen

Participants: Anton Freudenthaler, Alex Tao, Axel Savén Östebo & Mattias Nilsen

1. Objectives (5 min)
Go even more into detail about gameplay elements to make it possible to use notes from this meeting to write use cases.

2. Reports (15 min) From previous meetings, (un)solved issues, 
We’ve all had our first supervised meeting and discussed some details with our supervisor.

3. Discussion items (35 min) 

Discussion of different playable characters and their different primary and secondary abilities. All heroes should have a primary and secondary ability and those abilities should complement each other. Each hero should have a “theme” to it. Should there be different limits to different heroes, for example one heroes max speed is 75% of another heroes max speed.


Discussion about win criterias in a game. Could be that a player dies a specified number of times, a player takes control of all the towers or a player has access to towers for a long period of time. How should we make the GUI very clearly indicate who is winning if there are a lot of win conditions? There should either be a specified time limit to a game or some sort of sudden death, a game should not be able to continue indefinitely.


A player should be able to take control of towers and gain different perks from them. Some or all towers could have some sort of offensive capability when controlled by a player. If a player loses a tower should the player lose the given perks? A player should have a starting tower that is more important than the others.


Discussion about what kind of different blocks there should be in the game
