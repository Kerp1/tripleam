Meeting Agenda

Date: 2014-03-19

Facilitator: Anton Freudenthaler

Participants: Anton Freudenthaler, Alex Tao, Axel Savén Östebo & Mattias Nilsen

1. Objectives (5 min) 
Discuss game ideas and concepts to get a clear picture of what kind of game we want to create.

2. Reports
Everyone has thought about the game ideas we had last meeting and prepared arguments for the different games.

3. Discussion items (35 min) 

We discussed which game we wanted to create.

We discussed gameplay elements and general look and feel. Some essential use cases have also been started, such as player move and player action. 

4. Outcomes and assignments (5 min) 
We decided that we would go with the Bomberman idea with some adjustments to make it unique. 


We decided that the standard playmode is 1vs1 with objectives you can capture. 

It was decided that we should use a 2D-view but draw the sprites in such a way that you get a 3D feel to it.

Mattias should create our git repo and setup the initial project


All of us should, after our supervisor meeting, create use cases for our game.


5. Wrap up 
Prioritized unsolved things are hero powers, code structure and use cases.
 

Next meeting will be Thursday 20/2 11:00 - 12:00
