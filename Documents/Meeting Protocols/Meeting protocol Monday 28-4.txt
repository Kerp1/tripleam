Meeting Agenda

Date: 2014-04-28

Facilitator: Mattias Nilsen

Participants: Anton Freudenthaler, Alex Tao, Axel Savén Östebo & Mattias Nilsen

1. Objectives (5 min)  
Decide workload for all project members after vacations.
The graphic style we have chosen should be implemented during the week, that includes correct sorting of every object on the screen to mimic a 3D effect and drawing of correct sprites. Tests should be written.

2. Reports (15 min) From previous meetings, (un)solved issues, 
Alex has began work on the sorting of objects to make sure they are drawn in the correct order to get a 3D feeling.
Axel has began implementation of the GUI, including the statusbar that should display score, team names etc.
Anton has done some work on the bomb and bomber class, enabling it to explode after a certain time and some work on sprites and animations.
Mattias has continued to work on the implementation of towers and their ability to attack players that are near them.

3. Discussion items (35 min) 
How should the sorting of all objects be implemented, it doesn’t always work as intended.
What components are needed to handle player death and respawn? A starting position, a timer until respawn, the hero should probably be set to a state called dead so other components can check for it?

4. Outcomes and assignments (5 min) 

Mattias should continue with the tower implementation.
Alex should continue with the sorting implementation.
Axel should continue with the status bar implementation.
Anton should write tests and redraw sprites.

5. Wrap up 

Next meeting will be Friday 02/05
